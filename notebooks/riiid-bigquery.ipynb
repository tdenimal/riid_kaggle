I was resorting to breaking up tables and still waiting a long time to see the results of my analysis and to process my engineered features, so I decided to learn about BigQuery. This kernel is the current state of my setup, which is working very well. It is much faster than my previous local setup, even with having to download files. It also is making it easier to keep the structure of the data and and code clean, which in turn makes it easier to stay focused on thinking about and executing ideas without getting bogged down waiting for things to finish or wading through extraneous processing code.\n","\n","I've attempted to put  this book together in such a way that somebody else can fork it, update a few environment variables, run it and then be in the game engineering features and improving the model. The only requirements are a GCP project and storage bucket. Other than that, it is turn key, starting with creating a BigQuery dataset and ending with a saved model and two feature tables that get uploaded to a Kaggle dataset where they are used in a separate kernel to make predictions and submit to the competition api.\n","\n","A couple of cool features:\n","* Uses the gcs version of the competition datset to create a dataset and upload to BigQuery in around a minute\n","* Transformations get run on the entire train table at once and run in under 10 minutes\n","* Feature engineering gets done on a sample of the train table, taking advantage of BigQuery' graphical query editing interface that includes tab completion, syntax checking and the ability to run queries and inspect results\n","* Stores queries as methods on a dedicated class, where they can be easily reused\n","* Dtypes for local dataframes, schema for BigQuery tables and all tranformations are maintained locally so that the transformed tables can be recreated from the original competition dataset files automatically at any time (see description of workflow below to continue with this practice)\n","* Exports to gcs using temporary tables created by BigQuery avoiding unnecessary storage and wasted time rerunning and exporting duplicate queries\n","* Separate [submission kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/calebeverett/riiid-submit) uses sqlite3 to achieve sub two hour submission times while maintaining state for questions, users and user-content (80+ million rows)\n","\n","I've engineered a few features as a starting point to demonstrate how additional features can be efficiently developed and processed, including:\n","* Cumulative and rolling sums of questions answered correctly and incorrectly by user\n","* Percent of questions answered correctly by question id, part and the first question tag\n","\n","The model is also just a starting point, with a first pass at a train/validation split and no hyperparameter tuning. I have included some basic diagnostics on both the train/validtion split and model performance as a starting place for further development.\n","\n","I have the table creation and transformation functions set to not run, but you can set them to run, by changing the flags to `True` for:\n","* Loading tables - one flag for the questions table and another for the train and lectures tables\n","* Updating the schemas in BigQuery\n","* Performing the transformations"]},{"metadata":{"id":"savju5R9juQB"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Resources\n","* [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)\n","* [Python Client for Google BigQuery](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/index.html)\n","* [Analytic function concepts in Standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/analytic-function-concepts)\n","* [XGBoost Documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n","* [Storge Client](https://googleapis.dev/python/storage/latest/client.html)\n","* [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)\n","* [Plotly Python Open Source Graphing Library](https://plotly.com/python/)\n","* [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)"]},{"metadata":{"id":"88t93RZzj982"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Imports"]},{"metadata":{"id":"tKe4S7M4nbSU","_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"tags":[]},"cell_type":"code","source":["# <hide-input>\n","%load_ext autoreload\n","%autoreload 2\n","\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import gc\n","import json\n","import os\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import re\n","import subprocess\n","import sys\n","import time\n","\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from google.cloud import storage, bigquery\n","from google.cloud.bigquery import SchemaField\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n","\n","BUCKET = 'kaggle_tdenimal'\n","DATASET = 'riid'\n","LOCATION = 'US'\n","KAGGLE_SUBMIT_DATASET = 'riiid-submission'\n","PROJECT = 'learninggcp82'\n","\n","os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = \"../data/01_raw/learninggcp82-9d40293c9b3b.json\"\n","#os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = \"../input/gcp-credentials/learninggcp82-9d40293c9b3b.json\"\n","    \n","bucket = storage.Client(project=PROJECT).get_bucket(BUCKET)\n","dataset = bigquery.Dataset(f'{PROJECT}.{DATASET}')\n","bq_client = bigquery.Client(project=PROJECT, location=LOCATION)\n","\n","import plotly\n","import plotly.express as px\n","from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\n","# import xgboost as xgb\n","pd.options.plotting.backend = 'plotly'"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"3I6-yy4QBxlR"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Modules\n","Included in notebook for convenience when in a Kaggle kernel.

The [Python Client for Google BigQuery](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/index.html) [to_dataframe()](https://googleapis.dev/python/bigquery/latest/generated/google.cloud.bigquery.job.QueryJob.html?highlight=to_dataframe#google.cloud.bigquery.job.QueryJob.to_dataframe) makes it possible to create dataframes directly, but is prohibitively slow for large datasets. While it is not possible to export table directly to the local file system, it is possible to export to cloud storage and then download locally from there. This is reasonably efficient, taking a couple of minutes to run a query, export to cloud storage, download to the local file system and then read the files into a dataframe. The is another api, the [BigQuery Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage), that a client can be created with that is really fast and works with the `to_dataframe` method, but unforunatley it isn't working with the current Kaggle kernel environment.\n","\n","The functions below take advantage of the fact BigQuery stores queries in temporary tables so that preveiously requested queries can be retrieved without having to run them again. Similarly, the functions below name the exported files with the reference to the BigQuery temporary table, so that if a function is run to create a dataframe from a query for which the files already exist in cloud storage or locally, they won't be exported or downloaded again.
